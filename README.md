# MRF Thalamic Gating Model

This repository contains code for abstractly simulating the modulatory effects of the MRF (Midbrain Reticular Formation) on the neuronal activity of the RN (Reticular Nucleus). The model illustrates the inhibitory relationship between the MRF and RN. Activity levels of the MRF are manipulated in an oscillatory manner, thereby modulating RN activity through inhibitory connections.


### Model Description
At the moment this code operates on the basis of arbitraty input and tuning values. It currently only reflects a basic inhibitory model as seen in the literature. Future work will involve a more advanced model that incorporates more realistic parameters and input values relevant to the MRF-RN pathway and the sensory gating role of the thalamus.
